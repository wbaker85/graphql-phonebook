# GraphQL Phonebook

This is a demo phonebook application using React and GraphQL, based on Chapter 8 of [The Univeristy of Helskini's Full Stack course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about).

It has the added feature of GraphQL federation across the various microservices that make up the application.

This is currently a work in progress.
